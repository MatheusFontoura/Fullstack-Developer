# Offset pagination without a gem and without a COUNT query: one extra row is fetched
# beyond the page, and its presence is what answers "is there a next page".

# At this scale that is the whole requirement. A list that needed page numbers, jump
# links or a total count would be the point to bring in Pagy and stop hand-rolling.
